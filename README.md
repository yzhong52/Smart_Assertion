Smart_Assertion
===============

Assertion won't give any allerts under release mode, which sometimes might hide potential bugs. 

However, we sometime may prefer to develop the project under release mode simply because of running speed. 

This smart assertion will give an error message even under release mode and pause the program by `system`

Only tested under windows.
